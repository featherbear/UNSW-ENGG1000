alt="Machine generated alternative text:&#10;ENG1000 Civil and Environmental Engineering Strands &#10;What is CAD? &#10;CAD is an acronym for &#10;Computer Aided Drafting&#10;. It has become the standard means by &#10;which engineering drawings are created, traditionally created by specialised drafts-&#10;people. Engineering drawing is standard method by which an object, component or &#10;structure is specified. The rules and conventions that control engineering drawing are &#10;specified in the Australian Standard AS1100. Students are directed to the Australian &#10;Engineering Drawing Handbook published by the Institution of Engineers, Australia for &#10;more details. &#10;Some example CAD packages are: &#10;AutoCAD&#10;, &#10;IntelliCAD, MicroStation&#10;, &#10;TurboCAD&#10;, &#10;RealCAD, Solidthinking, Struc-Plus &#10; and a host of others, often with the an acronym CAD &#10;in the title. They almost exclusively use the vector based system of computer graphics, &#10;though many are capable of bitmap graphics as well. &#10;CAD software&#10; allows you to create a collection of drawing objects in vector format. &#10;Consequently there are many similarities between &#10;CAD software&#10; and typical drawing &#10;programs. These include such abilities as: &#10; &#10;Creation of many types of elements such as circles, rectangles, double lines and arcs &#10; &#10;Resize, relocate and reshape individual elements &#10; &#10;Group and ungroup &#10; &#10;Arrange items in sequences normal to the viewing plane &#10; &#10;Align objects to a grid or to each other &#10;What Makes a Drawing Program a CAD Program? &#10;A variety of software products create visual images, and they can all be lumped into the &#10;category of “graphics software.” CAD software belongs in this group, as well as a variety &#10;of other programs. Several characteristics distinguish CAD software from other types of &#10;graphics software: &#10;There are, however, significant additional features in &#10;CAD software&#10; that are not found in &#10;typical drawing programs. These include: &#10;"></div>

alt="Machine generated alternative text:&#10; &#10;Ability to perform sections, cross hatching, etc. &#10; &#10;Ability to specify a drawing scale (eg 1 in 1000, 10 in 1, 1 cm to 1 m etc) &#10; &#10;Ability to specify all graphics aspects in mm rather than points (pen thickness, cross &#10;hatching, text height etc) &#10; &#10;Ability to specify an objects dimensions using numerical input rather as well as the &#10;mouse &#10; &#10;Ability to specify many different size of drawing sheet (A0, A1, A2, A3, A4 etc) &#10; &#10;Assignment of objects to specific layers – these layers can be edited, hidden and &#10;deleted in isolation to the rest of the drawing &#10; &#10;Creation of objects in 3D &#10;model space&#10;  &#10; &#10;Dimensioning to ISO standards &#10; &#10;Locate grid points, vertices, midpoints, tangents and normals using &#10;snaps&#10; &#10; &#10;Specification of scale so that a unit of measurement on paper is greater than or less &#10;than the real measurement &#10;Some graphics software products have one or two of these elements, but it takes all five &#10;to be a true CAD program. Many CAD packages also include 3D capabilities as well as &#10;rendering, animation and other solid surface modelling features. Other specific aspects of &#10;CAD packages are described below. &#10;Precision and Accuracy &#10;CAD is meant to replace manual drafting, so it must meet the standards of those who do &#10;drafting work. Part of the standard is mathematical precision. When you draw a line with &#10;CAD software&#10;, the line has an exact length, which the program can calculate to a &#10;precision of ten decimal places. Every line, circle, etc., is on a coordinate grid, the exact &#10;location of which &#10;CAD software&#10; stores in memory. &#10;When drawing by hand, it’s easy to be sloppy and let a line go an extra millimetre or so, &#10;or to jiggle the compass when drawing a circle. But such imprecise actions are impossible &#10;in &#10;CAD software&#10;. A 1 m line will measure exactly 1 m. Circles are true, angles are exact – &#10;even though a computer screen cannot display them accurately. Commands known as &#10;Snaps&#10; allow you to attach one object to another with extreme precision at exact locations. &#10;"></div>

alt="Machine generated alternative text:&#10;Automation &#10;CAD programs are designed to automate the manual drafting process which has been a &#10;demanding and labour-intensive. Flip through a textbook on manual drafting and you will &#10;see all the details that must be attended to before one can draw a single straight line. The &#10;right diameter pencil has to be sharpened in a certain way, the paper must be carefully &#10;attached to the drafting table, the T-Square and the triangle placed correctly, a &#10;measurement must be taken, construction points placed, and then finally a line can be &#10;drawn to connect the two points. Now consider drawing the same line using &#10;CAD &#10;software&#10;. You install the program only once (the equivalent of setting up the drafting &#10;table and placing the paper). Line colour, line type, and line width are often already set &#10;(or you can change them easily). Select the Line tool, move the cursor to the point where &#10;the line is to begin (perhaps using a Snap command for exact placement). Click the left &#10;mouse button once, move the cursor to the end of the line and click again. The line is &#10;drawn, at the exact length and width, to the exact colour and style. &#10;Other graphics software products automate creating graphic images, but only a CAD &#10;program automates drafting. &#10;Real Scale &#10;Real scale means that as you draw, you can use the actual dimensions of the object you &#10;are representing on the screen, without regard to fitting it on the screen. When drawing a &#10;house plan, for example, you draw a 4 m wall as a 4 m wall, not as a 20 mm line that &#10;represents a 4 m wall. If you have done manual drafting, you can immediately appreciate &#10;the advantages of working with real scale. It is no longer necessary to figure out whether &#10;to draw your plans at 10 mm = 1 m or 1 mm = 10 mm, or any other scale. Using real &#10;scale is an easier, less intimidating way of drafting, because you focus on your ideas, not &#10;on how to make the drawing fit the paper. &#10;CAD&#10; is flexible, however, and offers the option &#10;of drawing at scale, if you prefer to work that way. &#10;Coordinate Geometry &#10;Everything you draw in &#10;CAD&#10; will be placed on a simple, flat, two-dimensional plane. &#10;Every possible location on the plane has a unique address, which can be written in X, Y &#10;"></div>

alt="Machine generated alternative text:&#10;coordinates. There is only one place (at any one time) in all of &#10;CAD&#10;’s world that can have &#10;the address X = 1mm Y = 1 mm. To record both the length of a line and its position on &#10;the plane, the only thing &#10;CAD&#10; needs to know is the coordinates of each end of the line. A &#10;line with one end exactly at X = 5 mm Y = 5 mm and the other end at X = 11 mm Y = 5 &#10;mm must be exactly 6 mm long, and must exist at one and only one place in the &#10;coordinate plane. When you use &#10;CAD&#10; for the first time (and select &#10;Metric&#10;), the coordinate &#10;display is set to show distances in mm. As you move the pointer, the coordinate display at &#10;the bottom of the screen shows the X, Y coordinate position of the cursor as it moves &#10;across the drawing area. If the cursor is at X = 10 mm Y = 6 mm, then the cursor is 10 &#10;mm to the right and 6 mm above of a location known as the origin point. This location, &#10;near the lower left corner of the drawing area, has the coordinate address of X = 0 Y = 0. &#10;All other coordinates are determined by how far they are from the origin point. Using the &#10;origin point as a consistent point of reference for coordinate display is known as &#10;Absolute &#10;Coordinates&#10;. &#10;Vector Graphics Display &#10;A computer displays information in pixels, the little dots that make up an image on the &#10;screen. The more pixels, the higher the resolution of the image and the smoother the &#10;image. Paint programs and other types of graphics software are limited by the number of &#10;pixels available. Objects in these programs are defined by dots, so detail work can be no &#10;finer than the number of pixels available. &#10;Paint&#10; programs store images as a map of dots, &#10;and can’t define an image with detail that exceeds the number of available pixels. This is &#10;known as &#10;raster graphics&#10;, raster referring to the technology that places the pixels on the &#10;screen. Paint programs are sometimes called device-dependent software, because the &#10;capability to create and reproduce a screen image is dependent on the display resolution &#10;in effect on the device in use when the image was created. If you create a drawing on a &#10;low-resolution device, then move it to a computer with higher resolution, the image will &#10;look grainy or lumpy. The file storing the image lacks the information necessary to &#10;display the image at the new, higher resolution. The limited information about resolution &#10;also affects printing the image. The higher the resolution offered by the printer, the lower &#10;the quality of the illustration if it was created at low resolution. &#10;"></div>

alt="Machine generated alternative text:&#10;CAD programs couldn’t care less about pixels. Objects in &#10;CAD&#10; are defined by their &#10;geometric characteristics, not by the points of light that display the objects. For example &#10;CAD&#10; calculates where the endpoints of lines are to go and then connects them with pixels &#10;to form an image on screen. The program makes this calculation each time the screen is &#10;redrawn. This form of display is called &#10;vector graphics&#10;, since lines and other objects are &#10;defined by their geometric properties, which include vectors (headings). It is also known &#10;as &#10;device-independent&#10;, since display resolution is not limited by the capabilities of the &#10;device on which the image was created. This feature is handy when sharing drawing files &#10;with other users, because it doesn’t matter what screen resolution is in use by either user. &#10;You might use 640 x 480 resolution on your 14” monitor, and your associate may use &#10;1200 x 1000 resolution on a 20” monitor. &#10;CAD&#10; will display your drawing correctly on &#10;both monitors, using every available pixel to generate the image. &#10; &#10;Acknowledgement:  These notes are prepared from lecture notes originally prepared by &#10;Dr Gareth Swarbrick, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering. &#10;"></div>
