IF this isn't possible, then other scientific approaches (such as social or &#10;economics) should be applied. &#10;LCA addresses the environmental aspects and impacts of a product system. Economic and social aspects are, typically, outside the scope of the &#10;LCA. &#10;The individual phases of an LCA use the results ot other phases. T ne iterative approach within and beüeen phases contributes to the &#10;comprehensiveness and consistency ot the study. &#10;LCA is a relative approach that is structured around a functional unit. The functional unit (tu) defines what is being studied. All analysis are &#10;relative to the tut &#10;LCA considers all attributes or aspects ot the natural environment, human health, and resources. As such, possible trade-otts can be identified &#10;and assessed. &#10;Transparency &#10;Life cycle perspective &#10;Priority ot scientific approach &#10;Environmental tocus &#10;Iterative approach &#10;Functional unit and relative approach &#10;Comprehensiveness &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Untitled picture.png Machine generated alternative text:&#10;Question 2 &#10;Not yet answered &#10;Marked out of 4.00 &#10;Flag question &#10;This question refers to ISO 14040-2006. &#10;According to the ISO 14040-2006 document, the LCA process can assist in: &#10;(Click all that are true.
