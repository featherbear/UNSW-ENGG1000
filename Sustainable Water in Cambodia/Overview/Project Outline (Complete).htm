alt="Machine generated alternative text:&#10; &#10;School of Civil and    Environmental Engineering &#10; &#10; &#10;Objectives &#10;More than ever, engineers are turning their attention to areas in the world where the need is greatest. This project &#10;will allow you to learn from those who have taken their engineering skills to developing regions, and to work on &#10;the Engineers without Borders (EWB) Challenge for 2018. You will learn about the social, cultural, global and &#10;environmental responsibilities of engineering.  &#10; &#10;    &#10; &#10; &#10;Design Task Summary &#10;Engineers Without Borders (EWB) is a community organisation aimed at creating social value through &#10;engineering. The EWB Challenge is a design program aimed at developing innovative, creative solutions to &#10;sustainable development issues identified by EWB and a community-based partner organisation.  &#10; &#10;The 2018 EWB challenge partner is the Cambodian Rural Development Team (CRDT), working with communities &#10;communities and the environment through community development and natural resource management proje&#10;(EWB, 2018).  &#10; &#10;The CRDT is working with communities in Ksach Leav, Koh Khnear, and Puntha Chea along the Mekong River. &#10;There are a number of challenges facing these communities. Most families grow rice on small plots of land &#10;adjacent to the villages and away from the river, and rely on rainfall to irrigate these plots. However, rainfall &#10;patterns have been noticeably varied in recent years affecting rice agriculture and impacting household water &#10;sources. While rainwater collection is more stable for household use during the wet season, other sources (such as &#10;river water) must be used during the dry season. There is currently inadequate access to an electricity grid, &#10;although some families have solar panels, generators and batteries. The cost makes solar panels inaccessible to &#10;many families.  &#10; &#10;Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia. Photo by Asian Development Bank, taken on 13 November 2009. &#10;"></div>

alt="Machine generated alternative text:&#10;Engineers without Borders (EWB) has partnered with CRDT to provide engineering and design solutions for &#10;projects identified for the communities of Kratie Province. The designs and innovations that result from the EWB &#10;Challenge in 2018 will make a direct contribution towards CRDTs work within Cambodia.  &#10; &#10;Your task will be to design and build a &#10;rainwater capture and reuse system &#10;that could be adopted on a house in &#10;the villages in Kratie Province. The system should: &#10; &#10; &#10;Capture rainfall runoff; &#10; &#10;Have a first flush system to prevent contamination; and &#10; &#10;Consider the easy and safe reuse of the water within a house for a variety of uses &#10; &#10;Mains electricity is unavailable, so a mechanical or human powered system is required. Solar powered options may &#10;also be considered. You will need to consider water quality and quantity and how the water can be used within the &#10;house or other parts of the community. Your design must consider how the water availability could be stretched &#10;during periods where rainfall is inconsistent. The design should be simple and effort should be made to use locally &#10;available materials.  &#10; &#10;Project Lectures &#10;A series of lectures will be given to complement the project as outlined in Table 1. &#10;You will need to &#10;attend all lectures. &#10; &#10;Table 1: Lecture template for the project &#10;Project-specific lectures Lectures in common with all Projects offered by the &#10;School of Civil and Environmental Engineering    &#10;Introduction to the project and Cambodia &#10;Principles of Humanitarian Engineering &#10;Water and sanitation options for developing regions &#10;Teamwork &amp; Technical Report Writing &#10;Engineering drawing (CAD). &#10;Sustainable design and construction technologies and &#10;practices. Societal and environmental ethics &#10; &#10;Design Specifics &#10;Your design team is to provide advice on the most suitable water, wastewater and sanitation engineering &#10;works to assist the sustainable development of the community. Design solutions should be consistent with &#10;the information provided in lectures regarding the local culture and context.  &#10; &#10;Your project will involve the following stages:  &#10; &#10; &#10;Calculate the quantity and quality of &#10;water to be captured &#10; &#10;Consider the opportunities and &#10;constraints for possible designs &#10; &#10;Design a system that can:&#10; &#10; &#10;a.&#10; &#10;Capture and store water &#10;b.&#10; &#10;Divert contaminated water with a &#10;first-flush device &#10;c.&#10; &#10;Considers options for the reuse &#10;of the water within a house  &#10; &#10;Recommend how the system should be &#10;maintained to ensure future sustainability &#10; &#10;Remember: BE CREATIVE! THERE IS NO RIGHT ANSWER! &#10;Rainwater collection in Kratie &#10;(EWB, 2018) &#10;"></div>

alt="Machine generated alternative text:&#10;Deliverables &#10;At the conclusion of the course, you will submit a written report and a working model of your rainwater &#10;collection system. &#10; &#10;Deliverable 1: The Written Report.&#10;  &#10; &#10;The report should include details on: &#10; &#10;Identification of alternative options and the justification used in the selection of your final design; &#10; &#10;Details of the chosen design; &#10; &#10;Description of how your design is appropriate to the social, environmental, economic and &#10;technical context; &#10; &#10;Cost of construction and operation and economic benefits &#10; &#10;Discussion of the long-term sustainability and maintenance of your design, including options for &#10;ensuring this; &#10; &#10;Advice on the role of the community in the construction and operation of your design; &#10; &#10;Deliverable 2: Working model of the Rainwater Collection and Reuse System &#10;You are required to develop a concept plan, schematic and physical (i.e. working) model for the rainwater &#10;collection system.  &#10;On the day of testing, you will present the rationale for your chosen design and then demonstrate whether &#10;it is capable of meeting the criteria specified during the lectures. The winning design will be evaluated in &#10;regards not only to performance, but also expected reliability, ease of construction and maintenance, &#10;anticipated cost, and quality of construction. Designs that fulfil all criteria will be viewed favourably.  &#10;Marking Criteria &#10;The &#10;Final Report&#10; will be marked according to the following criteria: &#10; &#10;1.&#10; &#10;Process&#10; &#10; how was the final design reached; alternatives considered and justification of final &#10;decision. &#10;2.&#10; &#10;The Design Solution&#10; &#10; creativity and sound use of engineering principles; effective and efficient &#10;solution to the problem.
